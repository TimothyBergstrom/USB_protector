# USB_protector

The program installs itself in the hosts computer, pings the ip adress of the host and sends it to a gmail account. The program then installs itself in the root where it keylogs and takes screenshots at intervals, which it zips and sends to the same gmail account. 

It is capable to restart on computer startup and continues where it left off before the computer was shut down. The program has been shown to not be detected by anti-virus software such as Malware bytes, Kaspersky and F-secure. The processes are run in background to stay undetected to the user. The keylogs and screenshots are deleted after each zip, to prevent accumulation of data that might be detected by the user.

Note: The program will not run directly from github, since the program has been broken by purpose to prevent it being used for malicious purposes. The reason behind this project was to learn how computer viruses work and how it is possible to prevent and detect them. All the processes and root folders are named to easily detect if a computer has been infected by the virus for easy removal, which is why the main folder where it installs itself is placed directly in directory C:/ with the name "TOTALLYNOTHINGSUSPICIOUS". If you are interested in learning about it, contact me and I will provide you a compiled and working version.


The project was completed during a 2 days of programming.
